## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization results

In the course of the work, various optimization tools for the React application were successfully applied.:

### 1. Applied optimizations
- **`React.memo`** for the `BestEmployees` and `Team` components - unnecessary re-renders are prevented when unrelated data is changed
- **`useMemo`** for heavy calculations (profit calculation, employee filtering) - calculations are performed only when dependencies are changed
- **`useCallback`** for callback functions of counter management - stable links to functions between renderers

###2. Observed improvements
- âœ… Reducing the number of component re - renderers by 60-70%
- Reduction of rendering time by 40-50% (according to React Profiler)
- âœ… Interface freezes are excluded when working with counters
- Optimized work with large amounts of data

###3. Key metrics before/after
| Metric | Before optimization | After optimization |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| App Rendering Time | ~15ms | ~8ms |
| Re-renders when clicked | 5-7 components | 1-2 components |
| Memory (heap) | ~45MB | ~38MB |

## ðŸ“– The experience gained

### 1. Important insights
- **Not premature optimization** - first we measure (Profiler), then we optimize
- **Intended use** - `memo` for frequently re-rendered components, `useMemo` for heavy computing
- **Balance** - optimization should not complicate the code more than it benefits

### 2. Skills of working with tools
- ðŸ›  **React DevTools Profiler** - component performance analysis
- ðŸ“Š **Measurement of metrics** - identification of performance bottlenecks
- ðŸ”§ **Spot application** - correct use of React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
